* Natural numbers
** Peano axioms
*** The set of natural numbers $\N$
    Let $\N$ be a set and $f:\N\to\N$ a function so that the
    following statements are true:
    1. $0\in\N$.
    2. $n\in\N \Rightarrow f(n)\in\N$.
    3. $n\in\N \Rightarrow f(n)\neq 0$.
    4. $\bigl[n,m\in\N \land n\neq m\bigr] \Rightarrow f(n)\neq f(m)$.
    5. $\bigl[ S\subset \N \land 0\in S \land (n\in S \Rightarrow
       f(n)\in S) \bigr] \Rightarrow S=\N$.
    
    Usually, we write $n^+$ instead of $f(n)$.

    Also instead of $0^+$ we write $1$ and $0^{++}=1^+=2$ and so on,
    so the $^+$ function basically means $f(n)=n^+=n+1$.
** Existence and uniqueness
*** Existence 
    - There exists a set $\N$ which satisfies the Peano axioms,
      because of the infinity axiom of ZFC set theory.
    - The infinity axiom states $\exists X (\emptyset \in X \land
      \forall y ( y \in X \Rightarrow S(y)\in X)$ where $S(y)=y\cup
      \{y\}$.
    - The $S$ function here is the same as the $f$ function in the
      Peano axioms, \ie the /successor of an element/.
*** Uniqueness
    It can be proven, that the set of natural numbers is unique (up to
    naming) \ie if there is a different set $\N'$ satisfying the Peano
    axioms, there is a homomorphic bijection $\varphi :\N\to\N'$ so
    that $\varphi(0)=0'\in\N'$ and $\varphi(n^+) =
    (\varphi(n))^{+'}\in\N'$.
** Operations on natural numbers
*** Recursion
    Let $X$ be an arbitrary set, $a\in X$ and $f:X\to X$. Then there
    is a unique $g:\N\to X$ function for which $g(0)=a$ and $\forall n
    (n\in\N \Rightarrow g(n^+)=f(g(n))$.

    The essence of this theorem is that we can use recursion in
    definitions.
*** Addition
    For each $m\in\N$ we define $s_m:\N\to\N$ so that $s_m(0)=m$ and
    $s_m(n^+)=s_m(n)^+$.  Instead of $s_m(n)$ we usually write
    $m+n$. Using induction if $k,m,n\in \N$ the following can be
    proven (it is not that hard, you should try it at home):
    - associativity: $(k+n)+m=k+(n+m)$; 
    - 0 is a neutral (or zero) element: $0+n=n+0=n$;
    - commutativity: $m+n=n+m$;
    - simplification: $\bigl[(m+k=n+k)\lor(k+m=k+n)\bigr] 
      \Rightarrow (m=n)$
** Operations on natural numbers
*** Multiplication
    Similarly, we define a function $p_m:\N\to\N$ so that $p_m(0)=0$
    and $p_m(n^+)=p_m(n)+m$. Again, instead of $p_m(n)$ we write
    $m\cdot n$ (or $mn$).  Using induction if $k,m,n\in \N$ the
    following can be proven:
    - associativity: $(k\cdot n)\cdot m=k\cdot (n\cdot m)$;
    - $0\cdot n = n \cdot 0 = 0$;
    - 1 is a neutral (or unit) element: $1\cdot n=n\cdot 1=n$;
    - commutativity: $m\cdot n=n\cdot m$;
    - distributivity: $k\cdot(m+n)=k\cdot m + k\cdot n$ and
      $(m+n)\cdot k = m\cdot k + n\cdot k$.
** Ordering of natural numbers
*** Definition of $\leq$
   We can define the relation $R\subset \N\times\N$ as follows:
   $(n,m)\in R \iff \exists k (k\in \N \land n+k=m)$. Instead
   $(n,m)\in R$ we usually write $n\leq m$.

   It can be shown that $\leq$ is 
   - reflexive: $n\leq n$ because there exists $k=0$ so that $n+k=n$.
   - anti-symmetric: if $n\leq m\iff \exists k (k\in\N \land n+k=m)$
     and $m\leq n \iff \exists k' (k'\in\N \land m+k'=n)$ substituting
     $n$ into the previous formula we have $m+k'+k=m$ which can only be
     true if $k+k'=0$ which implies $k=k'=0$.
   - transitive: $n_1 \leq n_2 \iff \exists k_1 (k_1\in \N \land
     n_1+k_1=n_2)$ and $n_2 \leq n_3 \iff \exists k_2 (k_2 \in \N
     \land n_2+k_2=n_3)$. Substituting $n_2$ from the first statement
     into the second statement we get $n_1+k_1+k_2 = n_3$ \ie $\exists
     k_3 (k_3 \in \N \land n_1 + k_3 =n_3)$ where $k_3=k_1+k_2$.
* Integers
** Definition of integers
*** The set $\Z$
   We can define the set of integers $\Z$ using $\N$ with its
   operations as follows.
   - Let $=_\Z\subset \N^2\times\N^2$ and $(m,n)=_\Z(m',n')\iff m+n'=m'+n$.
   - $=_\Z$ is an equivalence relation (\ie reflexive, transitive and
     symmetric) and it defines a classification of $\N\times\N$
   - Each class represents one integer \ie an element of $\Z$.
   - $m$ represents the "positive" and $n$ the negative part of the
     integer which contains $(m,n)$, so two integers $(m,n)$ and
     $(m',n')$ are identical if $m-n=_\Z m'-n'$ \ie $m+n'=m'+n$ (note
     that the later doesn't use subtraction which is not yet defined).
   - Example: the number $-42$ contains all the ordered pairs $(m,n)$
     for which $m-n=-42$ \ie $m+42=n$ or
     $\{(42,0),(43,1),(44,2),\ldots\}$
** Operations on integers
*** Addition of integers
   - Since $(m,n)$ is basically $m-n$ we can define the operation
     $(m,n)+(m',n')=(m+m',n+n')$ because ${\color{gray}
     (m-n)+(m'-n') =(m+m')-(n+n')}$.
*** Multiplication of integers
   - Because $\color{gray}(m-n)\cdot (m'-n')=(m\cdot m' +n\cdot n') -
     (m\cdot n'+m'\cdot n)$ we can define $(m,n)\cdot(m',n')=(m\cdot
     m' +n\cdot n', m\cdot n'+m'\cdot n)$
*** Remarks
   - Note that grayed out equations are not entirely precise, because
     they are not yet defined.
   - Of course instead of class of $(7,0)$ we just write 7, and
     instead of $(0,42)$ we write just $-42$.
** Ordering of integers
*** Embedding of $\N$ into $\Z$
    - There is a homomorphism from $\N$ to the equivalence classes
      which contain the pairs $(m,0)$ ($m\in\N$)
    # - This means that there is a natural connection between the
    #  natural numbers and some of the integers \ie $\N\subset\Z$
*** A classification compatible with an operation
    - The classification (or the $\sim$ equivalence relation) of a set
      $X$ is compatible with the operation $\oplus:X\times X \to X$
      when $x\sim x'$ and $y\sim y'$ implies $x\otimes y \sim
      x'\otimes y'$.
    - The classification defined by $=_\Z$ of $\N\times\N$ is
      compatible with the $+$ and $\cdot$ defined on integers.
*** Ordering of integers
    - We say that for $k,l\in\Z$ that $k\leq l$ if there is an $n\in\N$
      such that $k+n=l$.
** Groups and semigroups 
   The addition $+$ on $\Z$ is associative, has a neutral element,
   zero, and for each $k\in\Z$ we can define an inverse $-k$ for which
   $k+(-k)=0$, and addition is also commutative. This motivates the
   following deffinitions:
*** Grupoid, Semigroup, Monoid, Group, Abelian group
    - A set $G$ and an operation $\otimes:G\times G\to G$ is a
      *grupoid* if for each $g,g'\in G$ the result of $g\otimes g'\in
      G$ (\ie the operation does not "lead out" of the set).
    - A $(G,\otimes)$ groupoid is a *semigroup* if the operation is
      associative.
    - A $(G,\otimes)$ semigroup is a *monoid* if there is an element $n\in
      G$ such that $n$ is the neutral element \ie $g\otimes n = n
      \otimes g = g$ for each $g\in G$.
    - A $(G,\otimes,n)$ monoid is a *group* if every element has an inverse
      \ie for each $g\in G$ there is a $g^{-1}\in G$ so that $g\otimes
      g^{-1} = n$. The group is an *abelian group* if the operation is
      commutative \ie $a\otimes b = b \otimes a$ for each $a,b\in G$.
* Rational numbers
** Definition
*** Definition of $\Q$
    Usually the set of rational numbers is defined as a set of
    fractions \ie numbers $\frac{p}{q}$ where $p,q\in \Z$. The precise
    definition is as follows:
    - We define the $=_\Q$ equivalence relation of $\Z\times\Z$ so that
      $(p,q)=_\Q (p',q')\iff pq'=p'q$. 
    - The $=_\Q$ equivalence relation defines a classification of
      $\Z\times\Z$ and the classes are the rational numbers \ie
      elements of $\Q$.
    - Addition: $(p,q)+(p',q')=(pq'+p'q,qq')$
    - Multiplication: $(p,q)\cdot (p',q')=(pp',qq')$
    - Ordering: $(p,q)\leq (p',q')\iff 0\leq (p'q-q'p)qq'$
    - Instead of $(p,q)$ we write of course $\frac{p}{q}$ or $p/q$,
      and instead of $=_\Q$ we use simply $=$
    - $\Z$ can be embedded into $\Q$ using the mapping $k\mapsto (k,1)$
    - The classification is compatible with addition on multiplication
** Rings
*** Ring, integral domain, skew field, field
    Let $R$ be a set with two operations $+:R\times R\to R$ and
    $\otimes:R\times R \to R$.
    - $(R,+,\otimes)$ is a ring if $(R,+)$ is an abelian group,
      $(R,\otimes)$ is a semigroup, and the two operations are
      distributive, \ie $a\otimes(b+c)=a\otimes b+a\otimes c$ and
      $(b+c)\otimes a=b\otimes a+c\otimes a$ for each $a,b,c\in R$
    - A ring $(R,+,\otimes)$ is a *commutative ring* if the $\otimes$
      operation is commutative \ie $a\otimes b=b\otimes a$ for each
      $a,b\in R$.
    - A ring is a *unitary ring* if there is a multiplicative unity
      \ie an element $u\in R$ so that $u\otimes a = a \otimes u = a$ for
      each $a\in R$.
    - A *zero ring* is a ring that contains only one element, and that
      has to be the zero element $0$ (\ie the neutral element of the
      additive group).
      - The term "zero ring" sometimes refers to the other trivial
        ring, in which $a\otimes b=0$ for any $a,b\in R$.
** Integral domain, skew field, field
*** Integral domain, skew field, field
    - Two element $a$ and $b$ of a ring are *zero divisors* if $a\neq
      0$ and $b\neq 0$ and $a\otimes b = 0$
    - A nonzero [fn:: a ring with at least two elements] commutative
      ring $(R,+,\otimes)$ is an *integral domain* if it has no zero
      divisors. [fn::An equivalent definition of the integral domain
      is a nonzero commutative ring such that $a\otimes b=0$ implies
      $a=0 \lor b=0$ for each $a,b\in R$.]
      - An integral domain is ordered if $R$ is ordered with a $\leq$
        relation so that for all $a,b,c\in R$:
	- addition is monotonous: $a\leq b \Rightarrow a+c\leq b+c$
	- multiplication is monotonous $0\leq a,b \Rightarrow 0\leq
          a\otimes b$
    - The ring $(R,+,\otimes)$ is a *division ring* or a *skew field*
      if $(R\setminus\{0\},\otimes)$ is a group.
    - The ring $(R,+,\otimes)$ is a *field* if $(R \setminus \{0\},
      \otimes)$ is an abelian group.
      - All fields are integral domains.
** TODO Examples
* Real numbers
** Definition of real numbers
*** Example
    - $\sqrt{2}$ (which is the diagonal of a unit square) is not
      rational! Because, if it were $\in\Q$ then
      $\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}$ for some $p,q\in\Z$ such that $p$ and $q$
      are as small as possible. Squaring both sides we have
      $2=p^2/q^2$, or $2q^2=p^2$ (we can suppose that
      $0<p,q\in\N$). We can see that $p$ has to be even \eg $p=2k$ so
      $2q^2=4k^2$, therefore $q^2=2k^2$ which implies that $q$ is also
      even, and we could have simplified $p$ and $q$ by dividing them
      with $2$ which would make them smaller (which is a
      contradiction).
*** Definition of $\R$
    The set of *real numbers* $\R$ is defined as an ordered field
    which has the leas upper bound property. The properties of real
    numbers are further discussed in analysis/calculus.
* Complex numbers
** Definition of complex numbers
*** Motivation
    - Even some quadratic equations have no /real/ solutions, \eg
      $x^2+1=0\iff x^2=-1$ or $x^2+x+2=0$ would have solutions
      $x=(-1\pm\sqrt{1-4\cdot 2})/2$ \ie a solution with a negative
      discriminant.
*** Definition 
    The set of *complex numbers* is defined a $\C=\R\times\R$ with the
    following operations:
    - addition: $(x,y)+(u,v) = (x+u,y+v)$
    - multiplication: $(x,y)\cdot(u,v) = (xu-yv,xv+yu)$

    Note: things become simpler by introducing the "value" $i$ which
    is the *imaginary unit*, \ie a "number" which has the property
    $i^2=-1$.
** Functions on complex numbers
*** Algebraic form
    If $z\in\C$, instead of $z=(x,y)$ we write $z=x+yi$ which is the
    *algebraic* or *rectangular form* of $z$.
    
    In this form, addition of two complex numbers $z=x+yi$ and
    $w=u+vi$ becomes $z+w=(x+yi)+(u+vi)=(x+u)+(y+v)i$; multiplication
    becomes $zw=(x+yi)(u+vi)=xu +xvi +yui + yvi^2=(xu-yv) + (xv +yu)i$
    because $i^2=-1$.
*** Functions on $z=x+yi$
    If $z\in \C$ and $z=x+yi$ where $x,y\in\R$ then 
    - $x=\Re(z)$ is the *real* and $y=\Im(z)$ is the *imaginary
      part* of $z$;
    - $\overline{z}=x-yi$ is the *conjugate* of $z$;
    - $\left\vert z\right\vert=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\sqrt{z\overline{z}}$
      is the *absolute value* or *modulus* of $z$;
** Polar form
   Since $\C=\R\times\R$, we think about $\C$ as a 2-dimensional plane
   called the *complex plane*.  Each complex number $z\in\C$
   represents a point on the complex plane.  In the rectangular form
   $x$ and $y$ represent the length of the sides of a rectangle
   defined by the origin $0$ and the point $z$.  But points can also
   be given as a distance from the origin $0$ and as an angle (usually
   measured from the positive real axis counter clockwise in radians).
*** Polar form
    The *polar form* of $z\in\C$ is $z=r(\cos \theta+i\sin \theta)$
    where $r=\left\vert z\right\vert$ is the distance of $z$ from $0$,
    and $\theta$ is the angle from the positive real axis measured in
    radians counter clockwise.
*** Argument
    Using the above notation, if $\theta \in [0,2\pi)$ then we say it
    is the *argument of $z$* and this is denoted by *$\arg z$*.  It
    can be calculated using $\arctan\frac{y}{x}$ and the signs of
    $x$ and $y$.

    # The argument of the complex number $z=x+yi$ (where $x,y\in\R$)
    # is \(\arg z=\begin{cases}\arctan\frac{y}{x}&\text{if
    # $x>0$}\\ \arctan\frac{y}{x}+\pi&\text{if $x<0$}\end{cases}\).
** Division in rectangular form
*** Calculating the reciprocial
    Let $0\neq z=x+yi\in\C$ ($x,y\in\R$). Then
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{1}{z} =  \frac{1}{x+yi} = \frac{1}{x+yi}\cdot\frac{x-yi}{x-yi} = 
    \frac{x-yi}{x^2+y^2} =     \frac{x}{x^2+y^2} - \frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i
    \end{equation*}
*** Division
    Let $z,w\in\C$ such that $w\neq0$. Then using the above procedure:
    \begin{equation*}
    \frac{z}{w} = \frac{z}{w}\cdot\frac{\overline{w}}{\overline{w}}=
    \frac{z\overline{w}}{\left\vert w\right\vert^2}=
    \frac{\Re(z\overline{w})}{\left\vert w\right\vert^2}+
    \frac{\Im(z\overline{w})}{\left\vert w\right\vert^2}i
    \end{equation*}
** De Moivre formuls
*** Operations in polar form
    Let $z,w\in \C$, $n\in\N$ $z=r(\cos t+i\sin t)$ and $w=s(\cos q+i\sin q)$
    - multiplication: $zw=rs(\cos(t+q)+i\sin(t+q))$
    - division: $z/w=\frac{r}{s}(\cos(t-q)+i\sin(t-q))$
    - exponentiation: $z^n=r^n(\cos(nt)+i\sin(nt))$
*** \(n\)-th root of a complex number
    Let $z=r(\cos t+i\sin t)$ and $n\in\N$.  $w\in\C$ is the *\(n\)-th
    root of $z$* if $w^n=z$ \ie the roots of the polynomial $x^n-z$
    sometimes written as $w=\sqrt[n]{z}$.

    By the fundamental theorem of algebra, there are $n$ number of
    \(n\)-th roots of $z$, and these can be obtained using the following
    formula: \[w_k=\sqrt[n]{r}\left(\cos\frac{t+2k\pi}{n}
    +i\sin\frac{t+2k\pi}{n}\right) \text{ for } k=0,1,2,\ldots,n-1\]

* Roots of unity
** \(n\)-th roots of unity
*** Definition
    For $n\in\N^+$ the $\varepsilon\in\C$ is an *\(n\)-th root of unity*
    if $\varepsilon^n=1$.

    The set of \(n\)-th roots of unity are denoted by $E_n$.
*** Example
    - 1 is a \(n\)-th root of unity for each $n\in\N^+$.
    - second roots of unity are $+1$ and $-1$.
    - $E_4=\{1,i,-1,-i\}$.
    - $\varepsilon=\cos\frac{2\pi}{3}+i\sin\frac{2\pi}{3}=-\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
      is a third root of unity, but it is not a \(4\)-th root of unity.
    - $E_n=\{\varepsilon_0,\varepsilon_1,\ldots,\varepsilon_{n-1}\}$
      where $\varepsilon_k=\cos\frac{2\pi k}{n}+i\sin\frac{2\pi
      k}{n}$.
** Primitive \(n\)-th roots of unity
*** Definition
    For $n\in\N^+$ the $\varepsilon\in\C$ is an *primitive \(n\)-th root
    of unity* if $\varepsilon^n=1$ \ie it is an \(n\)-th root of unity
    and $\{\varepsilon^k:k\in\N\}=E_n$.
*** Example
    - $E_2=\{1,-1\}$, $E_4=\{1,i,-1,-i\}$
      - $-1$ is a second and a \(4\)-th root of unity, 
      - but it is only a primitive second root of unity, 
      - not a primitive \(4\)-th root of unity
    - $\varepsilon=\cos\frac{2\pi}{3}+i\sin\frac{2\pi}{3}=-\frac{1}{2}+i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$
      is a primitive third root of unity.
