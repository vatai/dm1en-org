* Basic combinatorics
** Combinatorics
*** Combinatorics
**** The goal of combinatorics:
     - To organize elements of finite sets;
     - Counting the different possible arrangements.
**** Examples:
 - Out of eight people, two were born on the same day of the week.
 - At least how many people do we need for two of them to have their
   birthday on the same day?
 - At least how many people do we need for two of them to be born in
   January?
 - What is the number of all the possible registration plates /
   telephone numbers / IP addresses?
 - At least how many tickets do we have to fill out to win the lottery /
   bingo?
*** Basic counting
**** Counting  
     Given two finite, disjoint sets: 
    
     $A=\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, \quad $B=\{b_1, b_2,\dots, b_m\}$.
    
     In how many ways can we choose one element from $A$ *or* $B$?
  
     The possible answers: $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n, b_1, b_2,\dots, b_m$.
  
     Their number: $n+m$.
**** Example
     In a pastry shop, they have $3$ kinds of sweet pastries (cakes
     like: isler, zserb√≥, coconut cube) and $2$ kinds of salty pastries
     (croissant, pretzels). In how many different ways can we choose
     one sweet *or* one salty pastry? Solution: $3+2=5$.
*** Basic counting
**** Counting  
     Given two finite, disjoint sets:

     $A=\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$, \quad $B=\{b_1, b_2,\dots, b_m\}$.

     In how many ways can we choose one element from $A$ *and* $B$?


     The possible answers: $n\cdot m$.
    
     |          | $b_1$       | $b_2$       | $\dots$  | $b_m$       |
     |----------+-------------+-------------+----------+-------------|
     | /        | <           |             |          |             |
     | $a_1$    | $(a_1,b_1)$ | $(a_1,b_2)$ | $\dots$  | $(a_1,b_m)$ |
     | $a_2$    | $(a_2,b_1)$ | $(a_2,b_2)$ | $\dots$  | $(a_2,b_m)$ |
     | $\vdots$ |             |             | $\ddots$ |             |
     | $a_n$    | $(a_n,b_1)$ | $(a_n,b_2)$ | $\dots$  | $(a_n,b_m)$ |
 
**** Example
     In a pastry shop, they have $3$ kinds of sweet pastries and $2$
     kinds of salty pastries. In how many different ways can we choose
     one sweet *and* one salty pastry? Solution: $3\cdot 2=6$.
** Permutations
*** Permutation
**** Number of permutations                                       :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     Let $A$ be a set of $n$ elements.  Then the number of possible
     sequences of elements of $A$ is: $n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots 2\cdot 1$
     ($n$ *factorial*).  Here $0!=1$.
**** Example (sandwiches for breakfast)
    - $2$ (different) sandwiches can be eaten in $2!=2\cdot 1=2$ ways.
    - $3$ (different) sandwiches can be eaten in $3!=3\cdot 2\cdot 1=6$
      ways.
    - $4$ (different) sandwiches can be eaten in $4!=24$ ways.

    The $200$ freshmen students can sign the registration list in
    $200!=200\cdot 199\cdot198 \cdots 2\cdot 1 \approx 7,89 \cdot
    10^{374}$ different ways.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
      From the $n$ different elements, we have $n$ choices for the
      first, $n-1$ for the second, \dots

      Therefore the number of all possibilities is $n (n-1)\cdots
      2\cdot 1$.

**** Example
     - $5$ students attend an exam. What are the possible outcomes if
       - $2$ of them got grade 4, 
       - $3$ of them got grade 5. 
    
     Making a distinction between the five student's grades: $(2+3)!=5!$.
     | ${\color{black} 5}$ | ${\color{black} 5}$ | ${\color{red} 5}$   | ${\color{red} 5}$   | ${\color{blue} 5}$  | ${\color{blue} 5}$  | ${\color{black} 5}$ | ${\color{black} 5}$ | ${\color{red} 5}$   | ${\color{red} 5}$   | ${\color{blue} 5}$  | ${\color{blue} 5}$  |          |

     | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | ${\color{blue} 5}$  | ${\color{red} 5}$   | ${\color{blue} 5}$  | ${\color{black} 5}$ | ${\color{black} 5}$ | ${\color{red} 5}$   |          |
     | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 | $4$                 |          |

      The number of redundant sequences because the 5's can be
      interchanged is $3!=6$.  Similarly, the number of redundant
      sequences because the 4's can be interchanged is $2!=2$.

      - All possibilities: $\frac{5!}{2!\cdot 3!}=\frac{120}{2\cdot 6}=10$

*** Permutations with repetition (Multi\-set permutations)
**** Number of permutations with repetition                       :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     *A permutation with repetition* is a sequence of $m$ different
      kinds of elements, so that there are $k_1$ number of elements of
      the first kind, $k_2$ of the second kind, \dots, $k_m$ of the
      \(m\)-th kinds, and their number is:
      \begin{equation}\label{eq:permrep}
      \frac{(k_1+k_2+\dots+k_m)!}{k_1!k_2!\cdots k_m!} 
      \end{equation}

**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     - If we distinguish each of the element: $(k_1+k_2+\dots+k_m)!$.
 
     - If we don't distinguish the elements of the \(i\)-th kind: $k_i!$
       of the sequences are equal.
     - If we don't distinguish the elements of the same kind:
       $k_1!k_2!\cdots k_m!$ of the sequences are equal.
     - Ergo, the number of all distinguished sequences is
       \eqref{eq:permrep}.

** Variations
*** Variations (Partial permutations)
**** Example
    We have $10$ courses at the university, when making our time table,
    we would like $3$ of them to be on Monday. In how many different
    ways can we achieve this?

    Solution: The first class on Monday can be one out of $10$
    classes. The second one out of $9$, the third one out of $8$.

    Combined, the number of possibilities is $10\cdot 9 \cdot 8$.

**** Number of variations                                         :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
      A sequence of $k$ different elements from a set $A$ of $n$
      elements, is a variation, and the number of all possible
      variations is $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)=n!/(n-k)!$.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     The number of choices for the first element from the set $A$ is
     $n$, for the second element $(n-1)$, \dots, for the \(k\)-th
     element $n-k+1$ choices.

*** Variations with repetition
**** Example
    How many, at most two digit numbers can we make using the digits
    $0$, $1$, $2$?

    Solution: There are $3$ possibilities for the first digit:
    | $0$ |
    | $1$ |
    | $2$ |
  
    There are also $3$ possibilities for the second digit: 
    | 00 | 10 | 20 |
    | 01 | 11 | 21 |
    | 02 | 12 | 22 |

    Together:  $3 \cdot 3  =9$
*** Variations with repetition

     The number of $k$ long sequences of $n$ kinds of elements is
     $n^k$.
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:

     :END:
     There are $n$ possibilities to choose the first element of the
     sequence, $n$ possibilities to choose the second, \dots 

**** Example
     - A ``TOTO'' ticket (which has $13+1$ fields, where we can write
       $1$, $2$ or $x$) can be filled out in $3^{14}=4\,782\,969$
       different ways.
  
     - What is the number of all the subsets of a set of $n$ elements?
  
       - A subset of $A=\{a_1,a_2,\dots, a_n\}$ can be represented with
         $n$ bits:
       - $\emptyset \leftrightarrow (0,0,\dots, 0)$,
         $A\leftrightarrow (1,1,\dots, 1)$
         $\{a_1\}\leftrightarrow (1,0,0, 0\dots, 0)$,
         $\{a_3\}\leftrightarrow (0,0,1, 0\dots, 0)$,
         $\{a_1,a_3\}\leftrightarrow (1,0,1, 0\dots, 0)$, \dots,
  
       - How many $n$ long $\{0,1\}$ sequences are there: $\alert{2^n}$.

** Combinations

     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
      The number of subsets with $k$ elements, of a set $A$ with $n$
      elements is
      $\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
  
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
      First choose $k$ elements from $A$ considering the order they are
      chosen. This can be done \(n(n-1)\dots
      (n-k+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}\) different ways.
    
      If we ignore the order they were chosen, in the previous
      enumeration every subset of $k$ elements appeared exactly $k!$
      times. So we should divide by $k!$ to obtain the number of
      subsets with $k$ elements. 
**** Example  
     The number of different ways to fill out a lottery ticket ($5$ out
     of $90$) is: $\binom{90}{5} = \frac{90!}{5!85!}=\frac{90\cdot
     89\cdot 88\cdot 87\cdot 86}{5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2 \cdot
     1}=\alert{43\,949\,268}$

*** Combinations with repetition
**** Number of combinations with repetition                       :B_theorem:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: theorem
     :END:
     The number of ways to choose $k$ elements out of $n$ kind of
     elements is $\binom{k+n-1}{k}$
**** Proof                                                          :B_proof:
     :PROPERTIES:
     :BEAMER_env: proof
     :END:
     Let $A=\{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\}$.  Then every possibility can be
     represented with a $\{0,1\}$ sequence:

     \[\underset{\text{\color{black}choices of }a_1 }{\underbrace{1, 1,
     \dots , 1} },0, \underset{\text{\color{black}choices of }a_2
     }{\underbrace{1, 1, \dots , 1} }, 0,\dots, 0,
     \underset{\text{\color{black}choices of } a_n}{\underbrace{1, 1,
     \dots , 1}}\]

     Then the sequences contain $k$ number of \(1\)'s (the number of
     chosen elements), $n-1$ number of \(0\)'s (separators). Together
     $n-1+k$ positions, $k$ of them are chosen.  The number of such
     sequences is $\binom{k+n-1}{k}$.

*** Combinations with repetition
**** Example
     There are $5$ kinds of pastries in the pastry shop, and we want to
     by $8$. In how many different ways can we do this?
  
     Now $n=5$, $k=8$: $\displaystyle
     \binom{5+8-1}{8}=\binom{12}{8}=\frac{12!}{8!\cdot 4!}=495$
 
     How many different ways can we throw $5$ dice?

     From the set $\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ we choose $5$ (the order is not
     important, one element can occur multiple times). Combinations
     with repetition with $n=6$, $k=5$:

     $\displaystyle \binom{6+5-1}{5}=\binom{10}{5}=\frac{10!}{5!\cdot
     5!}=252$
*** Summary (without repetition)
    - Permutations without repetition: number of
      sequences of $n$ elements (order counts, each element appears
      (exactly) once). \[n!\]
    - Variations without repetition: number of
      sequences of $k$ different elements from $n$ elements (order
      counts, each element appears once, at most).
      \[ \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} \]
    - Combinations without repetition: subset of $k$ elements from $n$ elements (order doesn't
      count, each element appears once, at most).
      \[\binom{n}{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\]
*** Summary (with repetition)
    - Permutations with repetition: the number of sequences of
      $n=k_1+k_2+\dots +k_m$ elements, where number of \(i\)-th kind of
      elements is $k_i$ (order counts, elements can appear multiple
      times). \[\frac{(k_1+k_2+\dots+k_m)!}{k_1!k_2!\cdots k_m!} \]
    - Variations with repetition: the number of $k$ long sequences made
      of $n$ elements (order counts, elements can appear multiple
      times). \[ n^k \]
    - Combinations with repetition: multisets of $k$ elements from $n$
      kinds of elements (order doesn't count, elements can appear
      multiple times). \[\binom{n+k-1}{k}=\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!}\]

** Pigeonhole principle
*** Pigeonhole principle
**** Pigeonhole principle
     If we have $n$ pigeonholes and $n+1$ pigeons, then how ever we put
     the pigeons in the holes, there will be at least one pigeonhole
     with two pigeons.
   
**** Example
     Out of eight people at least two are born on the same day of the
     week.
  
     How ever we choose five elements from the set
     $A=\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\}$, we will end up with two elements that
     have a sum of $9$.

     Consider the sets $\{1,8\}$, $\{2,7\}$, $\{3,6\}$, $\{4,5\}$. Then
     from the five elements, two will be in one of these sets, so their
     sum will be $9$.
