* Second retake test - Discrete mathematics 1.
  1. How many possibilities are there?
     1) How many ways can we arrange 10 books on a bookshelf?
     2) How many 8 digit numbers are there with all digits different?
     3) How many matches are there on a tournament with 20 teams,
        where each team plays with each team (twice, a match and a
        rematch).
     4) How many ways can we award the bronze, silver and gold medal
        in a race with 100 contenders (if there are no draws and
        everyone finishes)?
     5) How many ways can we divide 10 hundred-forint-coins between 3
        people (if the coins are exactly the same)?
  2. Harry, Hermione and Ron are eating candy from a candy mix with 10
     kinds of candy (there is plenty of candy from each kind):
     1) How many ways can Harry pick 4 candies if the order does not
        count?
     2) How many ways can Harry pick 4 candies if the order does not
        matter, but each candy is of different kind?
     3) How many ways can the three of them pick 2 candies each, if
        the order does not matter?
     4) How many ways can the three of them pick 2 candies each, and
        all 6 candies are of different kind (and the order does not
        matter)?
  3. How many numbers are there from 0 to 1000, which are not
     divisible by 2, 3 nor 5?
  4. Solve the following congruences:
     1) $172x \equiv 6 \pmod {62}$;
     2) $21x \equiv 5 \pmod {14}$;
     3) $18x \equiv 5 \pmod {73}$;
     4) $x^2 \equiv 4 \pmod {9}$;
  5. What are the last two digits of $1789^{2001}$ in the decimal
     numeral system? Justifie your answer.
  6. In the anime Dragonball they use the currency called
     zeni. Suppose they have only 7 and 12 zeni coins.  How many
     different ways can you pay for a gadget made by Capsule corp
     which costs 200 zenis using only such coins?  At most how many
     coins will you need?
  7. An old woman goes to the market with a basket of eggs. She sets
     the basket down and a horse accidentally steps on it, crushing

     canâ€™t remember but that when she had taken all of the eggs out 3
     at a time, there were 2 left in the basket. When she took them
     out 5 at a time, there were 3 left and when she took them out 7
     at a time, there were 2 left. What is the smallest number of eggs
     she could have had?
