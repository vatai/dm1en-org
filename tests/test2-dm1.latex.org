* Second test - Discrete mathematics 1.
  1. How many possibilities are there?
     1) How many 8 digit numbers are there with a prime for each
        digit?
     2) How many 15 long sequences of the 26 letters of the English
        alphabet are there, so that two consecutive letters are not
        same?
     3) How many different flights do you have to have between the 30
        biggest cities in China, so that you can travel directly
        between these cities (each flight goes both ways)?
     4) At least how many bits do we need to store the unique id's of
        each of the 10000 employees in a company?
     5) How many way can we arrange 20 books on a bookshelf so that
        the 3 volumes of LOTR are next to each other (in the right
        order)?
  2. We have 10 boxes and 10 balls, both enumerated with numbers from
     1 to 10.
     1) How many ways can we put the ten balls into the boxes?
     2) What if we can put at most one ball into each box?
     3) What if the parity of the balls and boxes have to match?
     4) What if each box contains two balls?
     5) What if we don't use all the balls, but at least 2 and at most
        4 balls?
  3. How many 10 digit numbers are there in the 2, 3 and 7 based
     number system, where each digit appears at least once?  And how
     many $n$ digit numbers?
  1. Solve the following congruences:

     #+ATTR_LATEX: :environment inparaenum
     1) $17x \equiv 6 \pmod 117$;
     2) $15x \equiv 5 \pmod {20}$;
     3) $26x \equiv 5 \pmod {91}$;
     4) $x^2 \equiv 1 \pmod {13}$.
  2. What are the last to digits of $221^{1000}$ in the $6$ base
     numeral system? Justify your answer.
  3. A Coruscanton is a military unit of at most 500 soldiers. When
     the drill sergeant orders them to stand in line with eleven
     soldiers in each column, one soldier is left alone in the last
     column; if he orders them to stand in line with eight soldiers in
     each column, again, one is left alone in the last column; if they
     try columns of five soldiers, there will be two soldiers in the
     last column. How many soldiers can there be in the unit?
