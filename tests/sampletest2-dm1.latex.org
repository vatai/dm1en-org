	x&\equiv 2 \pmod{5}\\
	x&\equiv 3 \pmod{6}\\
	x&\equiv 1 \pmod{7} 
	\end{align*}
     2) There is an island with seven and nine headed dragons. How many
	dragons live on the island if the sum of all heads is 107?

* Solutions
  1. 
     1) $\frac{30!}{20!}=30 \cdot 29 \cdots 21$. The first prize goes
        to one of the 30 contestants, the second to one of the 29,
        etc.  (Variations without repetition)
     2) $30^{10}$. All of the prizes can go to one of the 30
        contestants (no restrictions). (Variation with repetition).
     3) $\binom{30}{10}$. 10 winners are chosen from 30 contestants
        and are given one prize. (Combination without repetition).
     4) $\binom{30+10-1}{10}=\binom{39}{10}$. If we select one
        "winner" multiple times it means he/she receives multiple
        gifts. (Combination with repetition)
     5) $\binom{5+5-1}{5}=\binom{9}{5}$. We give one prize to each,
        and we are left with 5 prizes to divide among 5 contestants,
        so that they can receive 0 or more prizes. So the remaining 5
        prizes choose from 5 contestants with repetition. (Combination
        with repetition).
  2. 
     1) $100^{10}$. The first ball can be placed in one out of 100
        boxes, and similarly with all the balls so $100\cdot 100
        \cdots 100=100{10}$. (Variations with repetition).
     2) $\binom{100}{5}\binom{10}{2}\binom{8}{2}\binom{6}{2}\binom{4}{2}$.
        If every non-empty box has to have two balls, then there will
        be 5 boxes. First we choose 5 boxes out of 100 which
        $\binom{100}{5}$ ways, then, for each such choice we choose 2
        balls from 10 to put in the first box $\binom{10}{2}$ ways, 2
        from 8 for the second box, 2 from 6 for the third, 2 from 4
        for the fourth, and the last two we put in the last selected
        box. OR $\binom{100}{5}\cdot\frac{10!}{(2!)^5}$, which is the
        same result, only now the second part is a permutation with
        repetition.
     3) $\binom{100}{5}$. See the explanation of the previous problem.
     4) $\binom{11+81-1}{81}=\binom{91}{81}$. For simplicity, assume
        each box can contain at most one ball, then the solution is
        $\binom{1}{2}$.  We can deduce this solution by making an
        alternating sequence of non-empty and empty boxes which starts
        and ends with a non-empty box (\ie NE,E,NE,E,..,E,NE). There
        are 10 non-empty boxes so in the sequence we have 9 empty
        boxes and all together $100-10-9=81$ unused boxes which we can
        put at the beginning or at the end of the sequence or beside
        any of the nine empty boxes (it doesn't matter on which
        side). So each of the not used 81 boxes has to choose one of
        the 11 places. (Combination with repetition).
     5) $\binom{50}{5}\binom{50}{5}$ The problem implies that each box
        can contain at most one ball, and the "same parity" means if
        the box has an even number then the ball also has to have an
        even number or both the numbers have to be odd. So we have 50
        odd boxes and 50 even boxes and 5 even balls and 5 odd balls.
  3. Binary: $2^{99}-1$. All possibilities (must not start with zero)
     minus the one case with all one's.

     Decimal: Use the logical sieve: $\frac{9}{10}\left(
     \binom{10}{10}10^{100}-\binom{10}{9} 9^{100}+\binom{10}{8}
     8^{100}-\cdots-\binom{10}{1}1^{100}+\binom{10}{0}0^{100}\right)$
     The $\frac{9}{10}$ multiplier is because $1/9$ of the numbers
     starts with zero.  The rest of the terms come as follows:
     $\binom{10}{10}10^{100}$ we select all 10 digits (don't worry if
     not all are used), then subtract when only 9 digits were used
     $\binom{10}{9}9^{100}$ (10 choose 9 ways to select the digits,
     and $9^{100} to build the numbers for the selected digit), then
     add back $\binom{10}{8}8^{100}$ numbers with only 8 digits and so
     on.
  4. 
     1) There is one incongruent solution because $\gcd(3,7)=1 \mid 4$
        and that is $x\equiv 6 \pmod{7}$ because:
	\begin{align*}
	3&x \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\\
	3&x \equiv 4-7=-3 \pmod{7}\\
	&x \equiv -1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
	\end{align*}
     2) $2x \equiv 5 \pmod{14}$ has no solutions because
        $\gcd(2,14)=2\nmid5$
     3) There are 2 incongruent solutions because $\gcd(6,10)=2\mid 4$,
        namely $x_0\equiv 4 \pmod{10}$ and $x_1\equiv 9 \pmod{10}$
        because:
	\begin{align*}
	6&x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}\\
	3&x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \text{ note that we divided the modulus also}\\
	3&x \equiv 2+2\cdot 5 = 12 \pmod{5}\\
	&x \equiv 4 \pmod{5} \text{ or } x=4+5t \text{ for } t\in\mathbb{Z}
	\end{align*}
     4) To solve this we can use the extended euclidean algorithm:
        $34x \equiv 2 \pmod{55}$ is the same as $-55y=34x-2$ \ie
        $34x+55y=2$
        |                        | $1$   | $0$  |
        |                        | $0$   | $1$  |
        | $34 = 0 \cdot 55 + 34$ | $1$   | $0$  |
        | $55 = 1 \cdot 34 + 21$ | $-1$  | $1$  |
        | $34 = 1 \cdot 21 + 13$ | $2$   | $-1$ |
        | $21 = 1 \cdot 13 + 8$  | $-3$  | $2$  |
        | $13 = 1 \cdot 8  + 5$  | $5$   | $-3$ |
        | $8  = 1 \cdot 5  + 3$  | $-8$  | $5$  |
        | $5  = 1 \cdot 3  + 2$  | $13$  | $-8$ |
        | $3  = 1 \cdot 2  + 1$  | $-21$ | $13$ |
        | $2  = 2 \cdot 1  + 0$  |       |      | 
	Now we have $34 \cdot (-21) + 55 \cdot 13 = 1$, multiplied by
        $2$ we get \[34 \cdot (-42) + 55 \cdot 26 = 2$.  So $x=-42
        \equiv 13 \pmod(55)$ is a good solution, let's check: $34\cdot
        13 = 442 \equiv 2 \pmod{55}$ is true!
     5) We did not learn any special way to solve non-linear
        congruences, so we have to use brute force.
	+ $0^2=0 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{5}$
	+ $1^2=1 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{5}$
	+ $2^2=4 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{5}$
	+ $3^2=4 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{5}$
	+ $4^2=1 \not\equiv 3 \pmod{5}$
	So $x^2\equiv 3 \pmod{5}$ has no solutions.
  5. The last two digits are $09$.  First we can reduce $1789\bmod 100
     = 89$, and we want to find $x\equiv 89^{1969^{2013}}$. We use the
     Euler-Fermat theorem, so we check that $\gcd(100,89)=1$ is true
     (it is true, so we can use the theorem).  The theorem say
     $a^{\varphi(m)}\equiv 1 \pmod{m}$ where $a=89$ and $m=100$.
     First calculate $\varphi(100) = \varphi(2^2\cdot5^2) = 2^{2-1}
     \cdot (2-1) \cdot 5^{2-1} \cdot (5-1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 5 \cdot 4
     = 40$, so $89^{40}\equiv 1 \pmod{100}$. If we find $r=1969^{2013}
     \bmod 40$ we are finished because then $1969^{2013}=q\cdot 40 +
     r$ and $89^{1969^{2013}}=89^{q \cdot 40 + r}=(89^{40})^q \cdot
     89^r \equiv 89^r \pmod{100}$.

     So now we are looking for the solution of $1969^{2013}\equiv r
     \pmod{40}$. First we reduce $1969 \bmod 40 = 9$. So again we use
     Euler-Fermat, $\varphi(40) = \varphi(2^3 \cdot 5) = 2^{3-1} \cdot
     (2-1) \cdot 5^{1-1} \cdot (5-1) = 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 =
     16$, so $9^{16} \equiv 1 \pmod{40}$.  And now we calculate $r' =
     2013 \bmod 16 = 13$.  

     Substituting backwards $r \equiv 9^{13} \pmod{40}$. Luckily
     $9^3=729 \equiv 9 \pmod{40}$, so $r=9^{13}=9^{4\cdot3}\cdot
     9\equiv 9 \pmod{40}$. Again, substituting back, we have $x\equiv
     89^9\pmod{100}$ which we can calculate as follows:
     \begin{align*}
     89^2 &\equiv 21 \pmod{100}\\ 
     89^4 \equiv 21^2 &\equiv 41 \pmod{100} \\
     89^8 \equiv 41^2 &\equiv 81 \pmod{100} \\
     89^9 \equiv 81\cdot89 &\equiv 9 \pmod{100}
     \end{align*}
  6. 
     1) The solution is $x \equiv 57 \pmod{210}$. 

	- First solve 
	  \begin{align*}
	  x&\equiv 2 \pmod{5}\\ 
	  x&\equiv 3 \pmod{6}
	  \end{align*}
          and now $c_1=2, m_1=5, c_2=3, m_2=6$:
	  - Solve: $m_1x_1+m_2x_2=1$ for $x_1,x_2=?$. We use the
            extended Euclidean algorithm on $5x_1+6x_2=1$:
            |               | $1$  | $0$ |
            |               | $0$  | $1$ |
            | $5=0\cdot6+5$ | $1$  | $0$ |
            | $6=1\cdot5+1$ | $-1$ | $1$ |
            | $5=5\cdot1+0$ |      |     |
	    So $x_1=-1,x_2=1$ and using the formula
            $c_{1,2}=m_1x_1c_2+m_2x_2c_1$ our solution is
            $c_{1,2}=5\cdot(-1)\cdot3+6\cdot1\cdot2=-15+12=-3$ $x\equiv
            -3 \pmod{30}$
	- Now we substitute the first two congruences with our
          previous solution, so we have
	  \begin{align*}
	  x&\equiv -3 \pmod{30}\\ 
	  x&\equiv 1 \pmod{7}
	  \end{align*}
          and now $c_{1,2}=-3, m_{1,2}=30, c_3=1, m_3=7$:
	  - Solve: $m_{1,2}x_{1,2}+m_3x_3=1$ for $x_{1,2},x_3=?$. We
            use the extended Euclidean algorithm on $30x_{1,2}+7x_3=1$:
            |                | $1$  | $0$  |
            |                | $0$  | $1$  |
            | $30=4\cdot4+2$ | $1$  | $-4$ |
            | $7=3\cdot2+1$  | $-3$ | $13$ |
            | $2=2\cdot1+0$ |      |      |
	    So $x_{1,2}=-3,x_3=13$ and using the formula
            $c_{1,2,3}=m_{1,2}x_{1,2}c_3+m_3x_3c_{1,2}$ our final
            solution is $c_{1,2,3} =
            30\cdot(-3)\cdot1+7\cdot13\cdot(-3)=-153$ ergo $x\equiv 57
            \pmod{210}$.

     2) There are $13$ (5 seven headed and 8 nine headed) or $15$
        dragons (14 seven headed and 8 nine headed). Say $x$ is the
        number of seven headed dragons and $y$ is the number of nine
        headed dragons, then we have to solve the Diophantine
        equation $7x+9y=107$. Now $a=7,b=9,c=107$ and we use the
        Euclidean algorithm:
        |                     | $1$  | $0$  |
        |                     | $0$  | $1$  |
        | $7 = 0 \cdot 9 + 7$ | $1$  | $0$  |
        | $9 = 1 \cdot 7 + 2$ | $-1$ | $1$  |
        | $7 = 3 \cdot 2 + 1$ | $4$  | $-3$ |
        | $2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 0$ |      |      |
	From the last complete row we can see that 
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:d}
	7 \cdot 4 + 9  \cdot -3=1
	\end{equation}
	which gives us $d=\gcd(a,b)=1$. Because $d=1\mid 107=c$ is
        true, there are solutions. To find them by multiply the
        equation \eqref{eq:d} with $\frac{c}{d}=107$ so we have
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dmul}
	7 \cdot 428 + 9  \cdot (-321)=107
	\end{equation}
	From this we see that one possible solution is $x_0=428$ and 
        $y_0=-321$ and from the formula we know all the solutions can
        be obtained as $x_t=x_0+t\cdot\frac{b}{d}$ and
        $y_t=y_0-t\cdot\frac{a}{d}$ for different values of
        $t\in\mathbb{Z}$ so we have
	\begin{align*}
	x_t&=428+9t & y_t&=-321-7t
	\end{align*}
	Now since we can't have a negative number of dragons on the
        island, we have to find a $t$ for which both $x_t$ and $y_t$
        are non-negative. Because $x_t=428+9t$ let's $\lfloor
        \frac{428}{9} \rfloor=47$, ergo $x_{-47}=428-47\cdot9=5$ is
        the smallest non-negative value for $x_t$ the next
        non-negative value is $x_{-46}=x_{-47}+9=14$ (note
        $x_{-48}=428-48\cdot 9=-4$ is negative).  Now for $y_{-47} =
        -321 - (-47)\cdot 7=8$ and $y_{-46}= -321 - (-46)\cdot 7=1$
        (again note that $y_{-45} = -6$ is negative).  Ergo the pairs
        $(x_{-47},y=_{-47})=(5,8)$ and $(x_{-46},y_{-46})=(14,1)$ are
        the two acceptable (non-negative) solutions.
